# Predicting the gender of voice using Spark's ML library

The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning pipeline, utilizing the capabilities of Sparkâ€™s spark.ml library, to classify voices as either male or female based on the acoustic properties of the voice by running a logistic regression on the data.
